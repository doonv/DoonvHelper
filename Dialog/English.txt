    Hello there! 
    Welcome to the {+DoonvHelper__DoonvHelper} Beta 2 Testing Grounds!
    Before we get started, {# ffffff}{*}PLEASE{/*}{#} switch to a temporary/debug save file.
    I'm experimenting with weird shit that may or may not go wrong, so please use a save file that you are willing to lose.
    Because it {# ffffff}{*}might{/*}{#} spontaneously combust.
    Got it?{0.3} Good!
    There are 6 directions for you to go from here. Each one showing off a different feature.
    Just go in a random direction and have fun! Please let me know of any bugs.
    Make sure to read the text in every room, It'll tell you useful information such as known bugs and how to use the entities.
    Oh and, If you're just looking for the comf, bottom left!{0.5} :))))

DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting_colorblocks=
    {~}{+DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting__colorblocks}{# 8080ff}!{#}{/~}
    {+DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting__colorblocks} are... well uuh... they're very cool and...
    uhhh...
    ...
    I'm gonna be honest, this is the most boring entity in {+DoonvHelper__DoonvHelper}.
    It's literally just a solid color. and It's not even solid! It's just... Something I guess...
    I only made {+DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting__colorblocks} because it made debugging cooler. But who even cares?
    Whatever...
    So uhh..
    Go have fun with it i guess??
    Known Issues: There are no known issues. {+thought}It's a solid color what did you expect?{+endthought}

DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting_dashcodegate=
    {~}{+DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting__dashcodegate}!{/~}
    The {+DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting__dashcodegate} is a switch gate. But instead of getting activated by switches,
    It gets activated by dash codes!
    Basically... You dash in a specific order, and then the gate opens.
    The arrows indicate how much of the code you have completed.
    Also, {>> 0.5}{# ff0000}{*}IF YOU SAY POINTLESS MACHINES ONE MORE TIME I'LL-{/*}{#}{>>}
    I'm sorry. Anyways!
    Have fun!!!
    Known Issues: Complete sound effect is kinda jank, will fix eventually.

DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting_badelineboost=
    {# d678db}{~}Custom Badeline Boost{/~}{#}
    It's like a badeline boost but with customization options... yeah...
    Most of the cool stuff is in Lönn. You can customize a lot of things so make sure to open up Lönn and check that out.
    The orb above you makes badeline say some stuff and triggers the cutscene with the birb.
    You can customize where that cutscene goes + golden support. {# 444444}{~}(Secret?){/~}{#}
    That is pretty much it.
    I hope you appreciate the :frogeline:
    Known Issues: There are no longer any known issues.
    
DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting_satellite=
    {%}{*}Custom Satellite!{/*}{/%}
    Custom Satellite is a custom version of the "bird color" puzzle from Chapter 1.
    The things you can customize are: 1. The code 2. The volume of the bleeps 3. Whever it's cosmetic. 
    That's basically it.
    I have added bird colors for all 8 dash directions and made sure they are distinguishable by color blind people.
    If you are colorblind please let me know if you can distinguish the bird colors.
    If you solve this puzzle you can get the crystal heart and-
    Just kidding. You get nothing.
    Known Issues: There are no unqiue sound effects for the new dash directions.

DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting_car=
    I am not sorry! :)
    Not at all! :)
    What were you expecting a comf showcase or something? :)
    (laughs villainously){0.5}               :)

DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting_comf=
    {# ffffff}{*}{~}{big}Comf{/big}{/~}{/*}{#}
    The legendary comf counter is finally here!!! After like...
    *sigh*{0.5} 800 lines of code...
    ANYWAYS
    Basically, You plot down a "Comfy Spot" trigger in your level of choice. And-
    ...
    {big}THATS IT{/big}
    It's as easy as placing down a strawberry, and then after that {+DoonvHelper__DoonvHelper} will handle everything else!
    When you enter a "Comfy Spot" trigger, your comf counter goes up by one.
    What do you do with comf? Not much, however I have added a comf door! It's like a heart door, but with comf.
    Btw the comf door only works with the comfs collected in the current level. Not the entire level set.
    Have LOTS of fun with this one!
    Also, if see the comf counter outside of levels with "Comfy Spot" triggers in them, that is not intended please report that.
    Known Issues: Does not play well with other mods that add collectibles and stuff. (E\.x\. Dash Count Mod, Death Count Mod)
    That's pretty much it, however I smell a lot of unknown issues.
    Oh btw will have to crouch-dash into the comf spots to get into them. You can crouch dash by binding it in the menu.
