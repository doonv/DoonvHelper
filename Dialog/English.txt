    Hello there! 
    Welcome to the {+DoonvHelper__DoonvHelper} Testing Grounds!
    There are 4 directions for you to go from here. Each one showing off a different feature.
    I highly recommend you open up Lönn and try to figure out how to use the entities without help.
    I want my entities to be easy to use so your feedback on your Lönn experience will be very helpful.
    But if you wanna play with the entities first, that's okay!
    Anyway,
    Just go in a random direction and have fun! Please let me know of any bugs.
    Make sure to read the text in every room, It'll tell you useful information such as known bugs and how to use the entities.

    {+DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting__colorblocks} are... well uuh... they're very cool and...
    uhhh...
    ...
    I'm gonna be honest, this is the most boring entity in {+DoonvHelper__DoonvHelper}.
    It's literally just a solid color. and It's not even solid! It's just... Something I guess...
    I only made {+DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting__colorblocks} because it made debugging cooler. But who even cares?
    Whatever...
    So uhh..
    Go have fun with it i guess??

    The {+DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting__dashcodegate} is a switch gate. But instead of getting activated by switches,
    [MADELINE normal left] It gets activated by dash codes?
    [] It gets activated by dash codes!
    [MADELINE peaceful left] I knew it.
    [] Basically... You dash in a specific order, and then the gate opens!
    It's that simple!
    The arrows indicate how much of the code you have completed.
    Known Issues: Complete sound effect is kinda jank, will fix soon.
    Also, {>> 0.5}{# ff0000}{*}IF YOU SAY POINTLESS MACHINES ONE MORE TIME I'LL-{/*}{#}{>>}
    I'm sorry. Anyways!
    Have fun!!!

DoonvHelper_doonvhelpertesting_badelineboost=
    {# d678db}{~}Custom Badeline Boost{/~}{#}
    It's like a badeline boost but with customization options... yeah...
    Most of the cool stuff is in Lönn. You can customize a lot of things so make sure to open up Lönn and check that out.
    The orb above you makes badeline say some stuff and triggers the cutscene with the birb.
    You can customize where that cutscene goes + golden support. {# 444444}{~}(Secret?){/~}{#}
    That is pretty much it.
    I hope you appreciate the :frogeline:
