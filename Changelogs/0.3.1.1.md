# DoonvHelper 3.1 Hotfix 1

There was a bug with the states of the NPCs which I wanted to fix but I forgot to fix it. So heres the fix for that, plus some other fixes which I forgot.

You can now have seperate animations for when flying and when walking. For example: With the Walk&Climb AI you can specify the animations for when on the ground (Walking) and when on the wall (Flying).
