DoonvHelper Beta 3.1 Changelog:
**(:exclamation: IMPORTANT) Create new instances of your NPCs!** I have done several major changes since the last build, and the NPCs may not work as intended. To fix this you must delete your NPCs and create new ones from scratch. I know this is annoying, but theres nothing I can do.
Changed the names of the following properties:
    - Max Speed -> Speed X
    - Fall Speed -> Speed Y
And they have slightly different functionality (see description for more info).
I switched `Acceleration` from amount/frame to amount/sec. (To maintain functionality: Multiply the old value by `60` to get the new value)
Anyways, onto the new features.
**DialogNPC supports C# & Lua Cutscenes** It works just like the trigger does! (Note: Due to how I implemented the Lua Cutscenes functionality, it runs the `onBegin()` function, not the `onTalk()` function)
**Walker AI Types now jump** Walker AI types can now jump when theres an obstacle in front of them!
**New AI Types** I added a lot of new AIs:
    - Swim AI: They only chase you when you're in water
    - Slime AI: They have to jump to move (Similar to Terraria Slime AI)
**Gore** You can now specify gore sprites in your `Sprites.xml`, making your guide killing sprees that much more satisfying! (Disabled for photosensitive users)
**Enemy Shooting** Enemies can now shoot you with a somewhat customizable bullet.

Wow, that was a lot.
