# Introducing **Doonv**Helper:tm: (Beta 1)

it's a helper which i made with a few cool things:

- **Dash Code Gate:** It's like a switch gate but activated by a sequence of dashes.
- **Custom Badeline Boost:** A badeline boost that allows you customize a whole lot of features about it. You can change the Ch9 End cutscene and stuff.
- **Solid Color Block:** It's a solid color. 100% Customizable color.
- **Custom Satellite:** A custom version of the bird color puzzle from Chapter 1. Not a total headache to customize btw.

I've added a map for playtesting these features so you can try them out easily. (It's called "DoonvHelper:tm: Testing")

To install simply drag the zip below into your `Mods` folder and have some fun!
