# **Doonv**Helper:tm: Beta 2 is here

Here are the new features added since the last beta:

- **:catpog: The Legendary COMF COUNTER :catpog:**: Collect comf like strawberries! This took a LOT of effort to implement, but it's here. Huge thanks to everyone who helped me create this, this would not have been possible without you.
- ***Comf:tm:* door**: The only practical use for comf at the moment. It works almost exactly like a heart door (Only counts comfs for the current level, not the whole set), but it counts comf instead of these boring crystal hearts.
- **Custom Intro Car**: Allows you to change the direction the car is facing and, :scaredeline: disappearing functionality :scaredbadeline:
- **fixes and stuff**: I fixed nearly all the known bugs from the previous beta

To install, simply download the zip below and then put it in your `Mods` folder.
Have fun with the comf!
